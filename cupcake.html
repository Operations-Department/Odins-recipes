            <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (180 degrees C). 
                            Line 36 muffin cups with paper cups.</li>
                        <li>Whisk together flour, white sugar, cocoa, baking soda, 
                            and salt in a large bowl. 
                            Add eggs, milk, oil, water, and vanilla extract. 
                            Mix with an electric mixer at low speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. 
                            Fill prepared muffin cups a little over half full 
                            (use a #20 or 3-tablespoon scoop).</li>

                        <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, 18 to 22 minutes. 
                            Transfer from pans to wire racks to cool completely.</li>

                        <li>Meanwhile, for the filling, combine powdered sugar, butter, shortening, milk, 
                            vanilla extract, and a pinch salt in another large bowl. Using clean beaters, 
                            mix with an electric mixer at high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. 
                            Insert a large round tip into a pastry bag; fill with filling. 
                            Push tip through top of each cooled cupcake to fill; 
                            wipe excess frosting off to create a smooth top.</li>

                        <li>Frost tops with chocolate frosting. 
                            Insert a small round tip into a clean pastry bag; 
                            fill with vanilla frosting. Pipe frosting across tops of cupcakes in loops. 
                            Transfer cupcakes to an airtight container. 
                            Store at room temperature up to 3 days or freeze up to 3 months.</li>
