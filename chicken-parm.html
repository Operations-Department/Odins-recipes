                        <li>Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
                            in a large, non-stick skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>

                        <li>When oil is hot and butter is bubbling, 
                            add chicken thighs and cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                            Turn chicken, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, 
                            and cook until juices no longer run pink, about 5 minutes more.

                            read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
